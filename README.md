### Folsomite

[Folsom][1] is an Erlang based metrics system inspired by Coda Hale's
metrics (https://github.com/codahale/metrics/).

[Graphite][2] is a realtime graphing system.

[Riemann][3] is a monitoring system suitable for distributed systems.


Folsomite runs in your Erlang virtual machine, periodically aggregates
all present Folsom metrics and forwards them to your Graphite and
Riemann service.


The canonical location for the source code is [on github][5].

Forwarding to Riemann uses the zeta library from reifyhealth [on
github][4].

Comments and patches always welcome!

#### Building and running

Any version of erlang suitable to run Folsom should be supported. Use
rebar to build like:

  ./rebar get-deps compile

You can start it from the shell:

       $ erl -pa ebin deps/*/ebin -s folsomite

#### Example config

  %% -*-erlang-*-
  {application, my_app,
   [{description, "my_app"},
    {vsn, git},
    {registered, []},
    {applications, [kernel,
                    stdlib,
                    folsomite]},
    {mod, []},
    {env,
     [{folsom, [{counter, [{my_app, my_counter}, {my_app, my_counter2}]},
                {gauge, [my_gauge]},
                {histogram, [{my_app, my_histo}, slide_uniform, {60, 1028}]}
               ]}
      {folsomite,
       [{graphite_host, "graphite.example.com"}]},
      {zeta,
       [{clients,
         [{default,
           {"riemann.example.com", 5555, {keepalive, 180000}}}]}]}
     ]}
   ]}.
